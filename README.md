## Description

Using **selenium** chrome webdriver to automate web actions and retrieve data from web pages.

## Installation
1. Install [Selenium for Java](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/download/selenium-4.17.0/selenium-java-4.17.0.zip) (4.17.0 version)
2. Install the Chrome [webdriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)  (121.0.6167.160 version)
3. Create a *config.properties* file to store the paths. Then change the key names to your own.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
